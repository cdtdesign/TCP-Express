            <p><b>Traveling Children Project (TCP)</b> is a dynamic program that engages the imagination of children through learning and enrichment in a very hands-on manner. The program is designed to provide parents or educators with useful resources as they plan adventures for the family or classroom. TCP is a child’s passport to fun experiences, through downloadable interactive travel activities, as well as, an online community where Travelers can safely share their journeys as posts in the Journey Blog, where Travelers are rewarded with Travel Tokens. TCP can be utilized by both parents and educators whose young Travelers seek new adventures. Parents will find our Destination Search to be a handy resource for finding family-fun venue locations, pricing, age range, reviews and much more. While educators will find the TCP Journey Kit a fun travel activity to get their scholars working on their writing skills through reflection and journaling about their journeys in the included Passport Journal.</p>
            <p>Along the journey, Travelers will experience a variety of destinations with their families. And unlike existing social communities, Traveling Children Project will provide a safe haven for experiencing and sharing child-appropriate adventures, filled with fun activities, contests and even rewards Travelers along the way through a Travel Token reward system that can provide deep discounts to select destinations. Upon completion of every 12 journeys, Travelers would receive a certificate of completion, while parents receive a treasure of memories captured in their child’s very own words, all collected as a keepsake memento in the child’s Passport Journal. TCP is recommended for children as young as three, to age 12 and beyond.</p>
            <p>MISSION: Traveling Children Project believes that experience is still the best teacher, next to a formal education. We like to foster that belief by encouraging children to explore sites, sounds and places around them and then reflect those experiences through creative writing. These positive experiences and self expression will help enrich their lives and broaden their horizons. It is our hope for our Travelers to go farther, by taking part in many educational, fun, safe and happy travels!</p>
